# Hypothesis Testing Summary for Chess and Cognitive Performance Project

## Objective
This project investigates whether playing chess has a significant impact on cognitive performance improvements across multiple domains:

- Reaction Time
- Stroop Test
- Digit Span Test
- Verbal Memory Test

## Hypotheses

### Paired t-test (Before vs After Scores)

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** There is no significant difference between Before and After scores in cognitive tests.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** There is a significant improvement in After scores compared to Before scores.

### Linear Regression (Chess Played vs Improvement)

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** Chess playing has no significant effect on cognitive improvement.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** Chess playing has a significant positive effect on cognitive improvement.

## Methods Used

### 1. Paired t-test
- Tests whether the mean difference between paired observations (Before and After scores) is statistically significant.
- Applied separately to each cognitive test (Reaction Time, Stroop, Digit Span, Verbal Memory).
- Significance level: **0.05**

### 2. Linear Regression
- Models cognitive improvement as a function of whether chess was played or not.
- Dependent variable: Improvement (After - Before)
- Independent variable: Chess Played (Yes = 1, No = 0)
- Significance level: **0.05**

## Decision Rule

For each test:
- If **p-value < 0.05**, we reject H₀ and conclude that there is statistically significant evidence.
- If **p-value ≥ 0.05**, we fail to reject H₀ and conclude that there is no statistically significant evidence.

## Summary

|:------------------------------|:--------------------|:--------|:---------------|:--------------------------------------------------------|
| Reaction Time Improvement    | Paired t-test        | 0.00014  | Yes           | Chess significantly improves reaction time.             |
| Digit Span Improvement       | Paired t-test        | 0.0132   | Yes           | Chess significantly improves digit span memory.         |
| Stroop Test Improvement      | Paired t-test        | 0.000017 | Yes           | Chess significantly improves Stroop test scores.        |
| Verbal Memory Improvement    | Paired t-test        | 0.0102   | Yes           | Chess significantly improves verbal memory.             |
| Reaction Time Regression     | Linear Regression    | 0.1308   | No            | Chess does not significantly predict reaction improvement. |
| Digit Span Regression        | Linear Regression    | 0.0151   | Yes           | Chess significantly predicts digit span improvement.    |
| Stroop Test Regression       | Linear Regression    | 0.2927   | No            | Chess does not significantly predict Stroop improvement. |
| Verbal Memory Regression     | Linear Regression    | NaN      | No            | Regression could not be performed (missing variation).  |

> Note: Verbal Memory regression could not be fully performed due to insufficient variation in the Chess Played variable.

## Final Conclusion

The results show that there is strong evidence that chess playing significantly improves cognitive performance across Reaction Time, Digit Span, Stroop, and Verbal Memory based on Paired t-tests. Additionally, linear regression analysis suggests that chess playing significantly predicts improvements in Digit Span scores. However, for other domains, chess playing was not found to be a strong independent predictor.

In summary, while chess appears to offer an immediate enhancement to various cognitive skills on the day it is played, when considering a broader timeline of 30 days, chess playing only leads to a measurable and significant improvement in working memory (Digit Span Test). This suggests that chess may have short-term cognitive activation benefits across multiple domains, but its sustained long-term impact might be more specific and limited to certain cognitive abilities such as memory retention.

It is important to note that if a longer-term dataset (such as six months or one year) were available, the hypothesis might have evolved differently. Scientific research has already demonstrated that chess positively impacts cognitive functions over the long term. However, under the current experimental conditions and limited observation period, the results are confined to these immediate and specific findings.
