# Chess Habits & Cognitive Impact

## **Project Idea**
In this project, I will analyze how chess-playing habits influence cognitive abilities such as reaction time, problem-solving, and decision-making speed. My goal is to understand the relationship between chess engagement and mental performance by collecting and analyzing chess gameplay data and cognitive test results.

I decided to work on this topic, because chess is playing a huge role in my daily life.And, there are so many discussions about whether chess is beneficial for mental and cognitive development of young people.So, I want to make this ongoing debates clear at least for myself, while I am doing my hobby everday.Now, I will mention the keypoints of my work.

## **Description of Dataset**
- **Total duration of each chess session**: I will manually record my chess playing time for each session.

- **Game Performance Metrics**: I will track my rating, accuracy, number of blunders, and mistakes from Chess.com or Lichess(These are the platforms that I use for playing chess.).

- **Cognitive Performance**: I will assess reaction time, problem-solving speed, and focus levels using cognitive test websites such as Human Benchmark and OpenPsychometrics(These websites would be changed if I can found better tools for this purposes.).

- **Game Type**: The chess format played (Blitz, Rapid, Classical) will be recorded to analyze its impact on cognitive performance.

- **Date of Play**: I generally play everyday chess, because I love to play it:) but, in this proccess, somedays I will not play chess, and then I make the cognitive tests for comparing the results. Each session will be recorded and the datas I obtained will be used in folowing phases.

## **Plan**
#### **Data Collection**
- Data will be collected throughout the research period while maintaining consistency in:
  - Chess platform usage (Chess.com or Lichess).
  - Playing time and game format.
  - Cognitive test timing (before and after playing chess).

- **Sources:**
  - Chess data will be manually recorded from my personal games on Chess.com/Lichess.
  - Cognitive performance will be assessed using Human Benchmark and OpenPsychometrics tests.

- **Data Recording Strategy:**
  - Information will be logged immediately after each session to ensure accuracy.
  - Data will be systematically organized in Google Sheets or Excel.
  - Confounding variables, such as fatigue and distractions, will be noted for better analysis.

#### **Data Preparation and Analysis**
- At the end of the data collection period:
  - Data will be reviewed for completeness and consistency.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Trends in chess performance and cognitive test scores will be identified using statistical methods and visualizations.
- **Statistical Analysis:**
  - Correlation tests will be conducted to examine the impact of chess engagement on reaction time and problem-solving skills.
- **Regression Analysis:**
  - Linear regression models will be applied to investigate potential relationships between chess-playing time and cognitive improvements.

## **Report**
## **Introduction**
The main objective of this project is to analyze the relationship between chess-playing habits and cognitive skills such as reaction time and problem-solving ability. This study aims to determine whether consistent chess practice enhances cognitive performance, providing insights into potential cognitive benefits of chess engagement.

## **Hypothesis**
- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** There is no significant relationship between chess-playing time and cognitive improvement. Playing more chess does not significantly affect reaction time and problem-solving ability.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** There is a significant relationship between chess-playing time and cognitive improvement. Increased chess-playing time is associated with enhanced reaction time and problem-solving ability.

## **Methods**
#### **Data Collection**
Throughout the study period, data will be collected using the following methods:
- **Chess Data:** Manually recorded from Chess.com or Lichess, including game format, accuracy, rating progression, and blunders.
- **Cognitive Performance Data:** Reaction time and problem-solving speed will be recorded from Human Benchmark and OpenPsychometrics tests.

#### **Dataset**
- **Date and Game Type:** Each chess session will be logged with a date and the format played (Blitz, Rapid, Classical).
- **Game Metrics:** Accuracy, rating, blunders, and mistakes per game will be recorded.
- **Cognitive Performance:** Reaction time and problem-solving test scores will be recorded before and after chess sessions.
- **Duration of Play:** Total time spent playing chess will be noted to analyze its impact on cognition.
- **Focus and Mood Levels:** Self-reported observations on concentration and mental state before and after playing chess.
