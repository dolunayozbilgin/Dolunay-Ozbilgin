# Chess Habits & Cognitive Impact

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to analyze how chess-playing habits influence cognitive abilities such as reaction time, problem-solving, and decision-making speed. By collecting chess gameplay data and cognitive test results, we will explore correlations between chess engagement and mental performance.

## 🎯 Research Questions  
- Does frequent chess playing improve cognitive skills such as reaction time and problem-solving ability?  
- Is there an optimal amount of chess practice for cognitive benefits?  
- Do different types of chess games (blitz, rapid, classical) have varying cognitive effects?  

## 🗂️ Data Collection  
### 1️⃣ Chess Playing Data  
- **Source:** Personal chess activity (e.g., Chess.com, Lichess API, or manual tracking).  
- **Metrics:** Game time, frequency, accuracy, number of blunders/mistakes, rating progression.  

### 2️⃣ Cognitive Performance Data  
- **Source:** Reaction speed & memory tests from cognitive assessment websites (e.g., Human Benchmark, OpenPsychometrics).  
- **Metrics:** Reaction time, problem-solving accuracy, focus duration.  

### 3️⃣ Enriching the Data  
- Compare findings with existing studies on chess and cognition.  
- Analyze trends based on game type (Blitz vs. Classical).  

## 🔬 Methodology  
1. **Data Collection:** Scrape or manually track chess playing time and cognitive test results.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Find patterns in playing frequency, mistakes, and cognitive test scores.  
3. **Statistical Analysis:** Conduct hypothesis tests on the correlation between chess engagement and reaction time.  
4. **Machine Learning (Optional):** Use regression models to predict cognitive scores based on chess activity.  
5. **Data Visualization:** Present findings using charts and graphs.  

## 📅 Project Timeline

- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn (for predictive modeling)  
- **Statistical Analysis:** SciPy for hypothesis testing  

## 📌 Expected Outcomes  
- Insights on whether chess improves cognitive abilities.  
- Understanding the impact of different chess game formats on cognitive performance.  
- A well-documented dataset for future research.  

## 🏆 Evaluation Criteria  
- **Originality:** Unique insights into chess and cognition.  
- **Data Analysis Quality:** Proper use of statistical/machine learning techniques.  
- **Presentation:** Clear documentation, visualizations, and explanations.
